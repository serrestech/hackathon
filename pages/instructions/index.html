                      <br>

                      <h3 class="subheading-item">B. Project files</h3>
                      <ul>
                          <li>You need to create at least 1 repository on GitHub to host your project.</li>
                          <li>You need to have at least on the root of your project a “README.md” or any other file that will describe the solution, software, language, algorithms used as well as any simple steps to use the project.</li>
                          <li>You need to have an open source LICENSE in your project.</li>
                          <li>You need to set a GitHub Topic to your (main) repository with the name “<a href="https://github.com/topics/serres-hackathon-2023">serres-hackathon-2023</a>”.</li>
                          <li>You should commit to your GitHub repo often and not only once at the end.</li>
                          <li>If there are compiled files please include them as compiled files also and not only their source code.</li>
                          <li>The organizers will be able to randomly check a few projects for violating the rules or using unauthorized work of others.</li>
                          <li>You can create these repositories before the Hackathon starts.</li>
                          <li>The implementation will be done in your own GitHub repository. At the end of the available time you will be asked for the link to the repository which will be <b>forked</b> from the official GitHub Organization that will be set up specifically for this Hackathon. Changes to the code after the fork will not be considered.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <blockquote>Here is an example of such a Project skeleton you can fork and start with: <a href="https://github.com/serrestech/project-skeleton" target="_blank">https://github.com/serrestech/project-skeleton</a>.</blockquote>

                      <br>
                      
                      <h3 class="subheading-item">C. Presentations</h3>
                      <ul>
                          <li>You will have only 5 - 10 minutes to present your project.</li>
                          <li>You will need to give answers exactly to each step of the topic.</li>
                          <li>The order of the presentations will be in the reverse order of submission of the Projects as it was done in the relevant form.</li>
                          <li>Since there will be a comparison of the solutions you should include any running stats (time of execution, cpu/memory configuration etc) that will help the judges decide.</li>
                          <li>If there is a demo of how your project runs please use a screensaver, images, video or any other file that will work offline. Avoid live demos using your laptop/phone etc.</li>
                          <li>If there are any presentation slides you are kindly requested to use stable formats such as pdf or HTML. Avoid ppt or online presentation services.</li>
                          <li>Due to the big number of teams you may be asked to make your presentation using a usb drive where you will have all your files. You will not be able to connect your laptop/software to the presentation machine.</li>
                          <li>Be to the point. 10 minutes is too short to explain everything.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <br>

                      <h3 class="subheading-item">D. Validation</h3>

                          <li>Except for the points for each solution, the presentation, UI and the code quality will be evaluated.</li>
                      </ul>
